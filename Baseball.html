            <h2>History</h2>
                <p>I have been playing baseball since I was in kindergarten. I have been on several all-star teams through out my years of playing. I bat lefty and mostly play shortstop, second base, and sometimes pitcher.</p>

            <h2>My Future</h2>
                <p>When I go to high school, I will try out for the Milikan baseball team. If I make the team, it will push me to work harder to balance both school and baseball. After that, I would like to continue to play baseball and college and might even be lucky enough to make the pros. </p>

            <h2>Challenges</h2>
            <p>I have gone through many coaches who yell their mouth off when you make a mistake. It makes you feel like you want to just quit and be done with it. But if you quit then and there, you wouldn't know what is to come and what you could be. But although they yell at you and it may be tough, they are just trying to help you improve.</p>
